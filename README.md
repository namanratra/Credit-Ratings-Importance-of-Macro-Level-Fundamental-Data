c.	Detailed documentation of panel data modelling

II.	Data processing files consist of all related files, including dataset files (including original, intermediate, and final versions generated by data processing; usually csv files), script files (.py files and a .docx file explaining SQL processes), and an .html file (Data processing structure.html) with a detailed graph depicting the data processing procedures of the project.

III.	Data modelling files consist of a Python script file (.py) used for panel data modelling and the exported csv files that contain results of univariate and multivariate analysis.
